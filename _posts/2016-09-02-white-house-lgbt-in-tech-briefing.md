Last week I had the privilege to attend the White House LGBT in Tech
Briefing. This was the third year of the briefing, an event aimed at getting
together some of the most talented and diverse technical minds in the country to
discuss some of the biggest problems facing our nation.
To gather together with all of these amazing people inside the residence and
workplace of the leader of the free world was an absolutely amazing experience
that I will never forget. I am humbled and honored to have been a part of it.

The day started off with an introduction from Raffi Freedman-Gursman, the White
House LGBT Liason, followed by Megan Smith, White House Chief Technology
Officer and Leanne Pittsford, organizer of Lesbians Who Tech and the woman we
have to thank for organizing this fabulous event.

Raffi gave us a great overview of some of the things the administration has
already done and what they're continuing to work on for the LGBT community while
Megan Smith gave us an overview of the tech focus and initiatives as a whole for
the administration. Leanne then gave an overview of what we'd be doing for the day and our larger goal, putting together a conference in November with over 3000
people to help continue the conversations from today.

From there Ellie Schaefer, the White House Director of the Visitors Office,
surprised us by bringing in the First Dogs, Bo and Sunny! Dogs are my favorite
thing ever so meeting the First Dogs was like my dream come true. I even got to
pet them and they were amazingly soft.

After this we went into "Asks and Offers", where some of us stood up and
introduced ourselves, and were able to ask something of the group and tell the
group what we had to offer in return. I was terrified of getting up in front of
all 300 people in that room, as well as whoever was watching on the White House
live stream, however it went well and afterward I was glad I did. Introducing
myself and talking about my work at RailsBridge and thoughtbot opened the door
to meeting some great people more easily.

After Asks and Offers, leaders of different white house initiatives, such as the
Initiative for Women and Girls, Criminal Justice Reform, the Environment, etc
all came up and talked to us about their initiatives and what problems they were
trying to solve and we split up into small groups to continue
that conversation and brainstorm about how we can help solve these problems with
technology.

I participated in the Criminal Justice Reform talk and I was really impressed
with the level of conversation and what we accomplished in such a short amount
of time. I'm very excited to continue the conversation and help organize the
Criminal Justice Reform track for the conference in November.
