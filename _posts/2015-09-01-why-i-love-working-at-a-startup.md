I absolutely love working at a startup and I have found it a refreshing change from
my previous jobs at large companies. Here are some of the main reasons why.

**1. You learn a lot more about the business**

In large companies, all but the top people are shielded from the majority of important
business decisions and discussions. At a startup, every employee is one of the "top"
people! Everyone has at least some say because there are so few of us. This has helped
me to learn a lot more about the business world in general than I knew before and I know
that if/when I want to start my own business one day this experience will have been invaluable.

**2. Every employee is valued**

You are not just a nameless, faceless cog in the machine. You are an individual
with thoughts and opinions and an individual value! You regularly are surrounded
by people with important titles and if there's something that you don't like, you
can tell them in real-time.

**3. There is much more flexibility**

Without a million HR policies in place you have much more flexibility to work in
the ways that suit you best. You're never forced to do anything just because. It's
refreshing to be treated like a grown up and not deal with petty policies designed
to keep adults from making their own decisions.  

**4. You're surrounded by passionate people**
This one is my favorite reason. Everyone I work with feels invested in the business
in tangible ways because, well, we are. We all strive to get things done in a timely
and efficient manner and we care about the quality of our work. Everyone puts their best
foot forward. It's nice to not be surrounded by a bunch of people just "phoning it in."

Those are just a few of the reasons I love working at a startup. I couldn't imagine
going back to a large company any time soon.
