title: _Ugh_ Javascript
---

As part of my new position as an Apprentice at thoughtbot I've been working this
week on upping my javascript skills. I did some javascript during the Iron Yard
and have contributed significantly to the Ember side of a friends festival
management application. However, I still lack a lot of the fundamentals of
javascript and have kind of forgotten how to javascript outside of the Ember
framework.

I'm glad to be working towards correcting that and I've been pleasantly
surprised to see how much I've been able to get done in Javascript the past
week. However, javascript is still crazy and every day I come across evidence of
it's weirdness.
