I"“<p>Fridays are investment days at thoughtbot, so I decided to use the day to
explore <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, a functional programming language for the browser. I was able to
pair program on making a Select2 implementation in Elm with my mentor JoÃ«l, and
it was a fantastic experience. One of the most interesting aspects that I learned
 was about Currying and Partial Application.</p>
