I"<p>Last week I had the privilege to attend the White House LGBT in Tech
Briefing. This was the third year of the briefing, an event aimed at getting
together some of the most talented and diverse technical minds in the country to
discuss some of the biggest problems facing our nation.
To gather together with all of these amazing people inside the residence and
workplace of the leader of the free world was an absolutely amazing experience
that I will never forget. I am humbled and honored to have been a part of it.</p>
