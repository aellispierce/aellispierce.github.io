I"À<p>When people talk about programming they make all kinds of wild comparisons.
They talk about jobs and workers and unicorns and they imagine that their metaphors are
so simple and they have named their tools so clearly that anyone can understand whatâ€™s
going on. Programming is fundamentally about being comfortable with
abstractions. To some people, when you explain server processes by saying
â€œa worker performs a jobâ€ all they can picture is a little man in overalls wiping
sweat off of his brow while he completes a difficult task. They want to know what
itâ€™s doing, <em>really</em>.</p>

<p>The thing is, the truth is even crazier than the metaphor. What itâ€™s doing is
sending little signals over wires and flipping circuits on and off. Computer programming
is somehow simultaneously the most real and logical activity and yet complete and
utter madness. The entire industry is built on clever metaphors and abstractions.
Nothing is actually what you describe it as, itâ€™s just a series of stories we
tell to â€œsimplifyâ€ things. Sometimes we think of people who canâ€™t understand these
things as illogical, they donâ€™t have the reasoning skills to parse it all out,
but really maybe theyâ€™re just super literal.</p>

<p>As I grow as a developer, I find that Iâ€™ve started to understand much more
complicated topics much more quickly by really learning to embrace the abstractions.
At first when I was in code school I wanted to understand everything down to the most
fundamental aspects, then I realized I couldnâ€™t without spending years learning to
program in machine code (and even then Iâ€™d have to understand the hardware bits to <em>really</em> get it),
so I started to just follow steps and patterns.
However, you obviously can only get so far with just following patterns. Now, as I grow,
Iâ€™m getting to ask the difficult questions and really try to understand things again and
the more I understand and embrace abstractions, the better I get.</p>
