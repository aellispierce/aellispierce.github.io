I"ë<p>Last week was the end of the second month of my apprenticeship at thoughtbot!
The client project that I was working on was mostly focused on API
integrations. This gave me some confidence going into the month, as this was very
similar to the work Iâ€™ve done on <a href="https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant">Active Merchant</a> while at Spreedly. There were
some differences in how the integrations were tested though that made the
project a great learning experience.</p>
