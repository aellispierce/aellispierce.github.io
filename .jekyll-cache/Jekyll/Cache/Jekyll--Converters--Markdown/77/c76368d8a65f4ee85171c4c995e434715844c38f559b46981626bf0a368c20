I"Ä<p>I‚Äôve been working as a professional developer for a little over 3 months now so I
thought I would stop and reflect on some of the ups and downs so far.</p>

<p>First off, I absolutely love my company and am grateful for the opportunity to join
them and glad I made this decision. Being in a supportive environment is paramount
to the success of a junior developer and I certainly think I‚Äôve found one here.</p>

<p>With that said, I don‚Äôt think anyone has every gone from a bootcamp (or traditional college)
into a full-time development job and not experienced some challenges. Based on those
challenges, here is the advice I would offer other junior developers.</p>

<p><strong>1. Ask for help</strong></p>

<p>I honestly hate having to ask for help. This is not a good quality in a junior developer.
I have been trying to work on this in the last few months and I‚Äôm definitely improving.
When I first started at my job, I would go literally hours staring at the same problem,
trying to figure out what to do and not making any progress. When I know what I‚Äôm doing
I work pretty efficiently, so I still got a lot done in general which kept me out of the
‚Äúwhat is that girl even doing?!!?‚Äù radar but man‚Ä¶if they knew how long I avoided asking
some questions‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Now I give myself a 30-45 minute limit and figure if I can‚Äôt begin to imagine a solution
in that time or find one on google I go ahead and ask the question. As much as I hate it
I know that wasting hours of work time staring at a problem is just not good for business
or for my own personal learning and development.</p>

<p><strong>2. Find a Mentor</strong></p>

<p>I know this advice is given a lot and can seem obvious but this cannot be over-stated enough.
For me, it really helped to have someone in our company who was specifically assigned
to be my mentor. This helped alleviate my fears about asking questions since I
thought ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs part of his job to listen to my stupid questions.‚Äù Additionally,
we have a weekly meeting that has been wonderful. Sometimes we talk about and pair on a specific problem,
sometimes we just talk about work/the programming world in general. Either way
it is immensely helpful to have this time to pick the brain of someone so senior.</p>

<p><strong>3. Be kind to yourself</strong></p>

<p>There are lots of things you won‚Äôt know. That is okay. You are not supposed to
know everything now.</p>

<p><strong>4. Get to know your codebase</strong></p>

<p>One of the hardest thing as a junior developer is figuring out how to navigate a large
codebase that others built. This is a skill that only comes with time, however when
something happens that you don‚Äôt understand, take the time to seek out the cause in
the codebase. Invest time in making sure you understand the general flow of the codebase.
Getting to know it well in the beginning will save you tons of time in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>5. Make time for outside learning</strong></p>

<p>Keep learning on your own outside of work. I‚Äôve come to find that even the most
senior developers spend time outside of work building new skills. This is how they
became senior and how they retain that position. If your company doesn‚Äôt offer
reimbursement for technical books or conferences definitely talk to your manager
and see if there‚Äôs a way to change that. You need those books!!</p>

<p>__</p>

<p>Those are my main pieces of advice. One more thing I‚Äôd suggest is, if possible, try
to find somewhere where you won‚Äôt be the only junior developer. This kind of goes
along with asking for help, but it has been a bit rough for me to get used to being
the only junior developer and the first junior developer the company
has hired. I did pretty well in the Iron Yard so I came into this used to feeling
knowledgeable and intelligent around my peers. Now I‚Äôm surrounded by people with
much more experience than me and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt say I feel knowledgeable
most of the time. I heard someone at RailsConf give the advice that junior developers
should be hired in pairs so they have someone of their own skill level to relate to
and I can definitely imagine the benefit and appeal in that. That being said, I
specifically picked this job because of the wealth of experience and knowledge my
co-workers had. I wanted to be surrounded by brilliant people who I could learn a
ton from. I succeeded in this goal. So I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a deal breaker as
long as it‚Äôs offset by a smart and very supportive team.</p>

<p>The first few months of any new job are tough, but starting in a whole new career
field certainly can make them tougher. Remembering these pieces of advice will
help make the transition easier.</p>
