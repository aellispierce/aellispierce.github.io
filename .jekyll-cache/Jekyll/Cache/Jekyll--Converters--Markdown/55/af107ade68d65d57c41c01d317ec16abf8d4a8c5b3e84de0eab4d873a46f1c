I"ç<p>I just finished the end of week two of my apprenticeship at thoughtbot and thus
far it has been an amazing experience. I was really nervous about joining, since
I absolutely loved my previous position at Spreedly and was really sad to leave
my awesome team. However, I knew that I could learn a lot at thoughtbot
and thus far this apprenticeship has definitely lived up to my expectations.</p>
